Content Gaps (high priority)

The current app covers the "what and how" but skips the "why it works" and the practical real-world stuff beginners actually get stuck on. Specifically:

GHL pricing breakdown — beginners always ask "which plan do I actually need?" right now it just says "Agency plan" with no context on cost, what's included, or cheaper alternatives for small properties.

AI voice platform comparison — we mention Bland AI, VAPI, and Retell AI but never explain the differences. Beginners need to know which one is cheapest, which has the best voice quality, which works best with GHL natively. This is a decision point where people get stuck.

Troubleshooting section — the most common issues beginners hit: AI calls dropping, SMS not delivering, workflows not triggering. This is missing entirely and it's where most people abandon setup.

Integration map — GHL connects to dozens of tools (Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb, Google Calendar, WhatsApp, etc.). Beginners need to know which integrations matter for hospitality and how to actually connect them.

Structural Gaps (medium priority)

A glossary or key terms page — terms like "workflow," "pipeline," "trigger," "drip campaign," "API key" are used throughout but never explained. For true beginners this is a roadblock.

A FAQ section — questions like "Can I use GHL without a website?" or "Does AI voice work internationally?" or "How many automations can I run at once?" These are the questions that come up after someone finishes the how-to steps.

A real example / case study — one concrete story like "Hotel X set this up in 3 days and reduced front-desk calls by 40%" makes everything click. Right now it's all theory.
